Simple utility for playing videos from YouTube in PiP mode and in the background. The video quality is hardcoded to 360p because only 720p and 360p are working more or less fine and the main reason of the utility creation is to be able to listen to video podcasts with locked screen.


No additional dependencies needed. Open project file and build.
